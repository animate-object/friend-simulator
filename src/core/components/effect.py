NOTES
A condition is an effect applied to a player.

A player can have one condition at a time

Conditions have a number of boolean properties that explain when they should be applied
e.g. my_condition.modifies_damage_dealt == True | False
     my_condition.modifies_damage_taken

     my_condition.deals_damage_to_effected_over_time
